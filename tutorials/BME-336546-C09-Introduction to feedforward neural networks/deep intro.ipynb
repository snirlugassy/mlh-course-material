For this taks I ask you to Write down your ID number on a white paper using a dark pen (blue or black). The digits should be separated from each other and about the size of 2X2 cm. Take a picture of your ID number from a distance of about 0.5m with your default focus. Make sure your image is clear and illuminated. Upload the image to your computer and cut each and every digit using \"snipping tool\". Make sure your digits are saved in PNG format. Name your first digit \"1.PNG\" and the second \"2.PNG\" etc. Save your 9 images in the same folder with your notebook."
